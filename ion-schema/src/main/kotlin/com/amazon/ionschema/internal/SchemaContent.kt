/**
 * A wrapper class for a stream of IonValue that is expected to be an Ion Schema document.
 *
 * The purpose of this class is similar to a C header fileâ€”so that we can know about all the declared types in a schema
 * document before we've fully loaded the schema document into the schema system. This is essential for being able to
 * resolve cyclical dependencies. See also [Forward Declaration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_declaration).
 *
 * This class performs some processing in its initialization block in order to determine the Ion Schema version and
 * the names of all the types declared by the schema document, but it does not perform any syntactic or semantic
 * validation of the schema document.
